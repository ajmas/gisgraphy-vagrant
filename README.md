Gisgraphy Vagrant
=================

Vagrant configuration for setting up a box to run
Gisgraphy.

This is based on the work originally done by Alistair
Coote for the project 'superbowl-tweet', found here:

https://github.com/alastaircoote/superbowl-tweet

Amongst the changes include:

  - moving to a 64bit VM
  - separating out the install script
  - providing a custom local name
